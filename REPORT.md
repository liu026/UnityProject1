CS 485 Assignment 1

This project include two game. 

The first game is a 3D game made step by step from the roll a ball tutorial.
https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial.

The second game is a 2D flappy bird style game based on a unity tutorial. 
This is not a exact copy of the game, I made many changes of my own.

INSTRUCTIONS: use the left mouse button the fly the plane, avoid hitting any rocks or the ground.
Hit SPACE key to retart the game if you died.


MODIFICATIONS: I used free assets from the asset store instead of the asset given by the tutorial.
That includes the player, background and Hazards.
The animations are also change based on new assets.
The screen will keep moving when the player dies.
Many objects in the games are improved with polygon collider instead of box collider.

I learned the basics of Unity. They are:

How to setting up projects

How to Adding Sprites

How to animate 2D Scripts

How to setup basic UI

How to write basic C# scripts.

The hardest part of making the game is that I am unfamiliar with the C# commands. 
The version of the Unity in the tutorial are also different. I have to setup the animations on my own.
The game can have many improvements, I really want to add sound to the game in the future.
